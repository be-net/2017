# Registration

Registration is **free**. Nonetheless the space is limited. Preference will be given to people presenting some work, and promotion of diversity will be a criterion of choice.

For those who don't plan to submit a oral/poster contribution,
you can register by simply sending an *empty* abstract with the
word `[REGISTRATION]` via [EasyChair][1].
